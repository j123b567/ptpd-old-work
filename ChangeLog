	* Leap second fix
	
2012-01-05  George Neville-Neil  <gnn@neville-neil.com>

	* 2.2.0 release

	* Patches: 3134556, 3296405

	* Added support for Mac OS X (tested on Snow Leopard and Lion)

	* Protocol implementation Fixes:

	* Bugs Fixed

	- Client now correctly accepts the Master DelayReq rate
	- DelayMS and delaySM now correctly show the sign when negative
	- Sanity Flags: client now requires -g or -G for slave/master operation.
	- Client can print the MAC address of its master (instead of EEUI)
	- master now sends ARB timescale only with utc_offset of zero
	- slave now only uses the last UTC_Offset if UTC_Valid bit is on.
	- passive masters no longer become active every 12s,
	- first delayreq is postponed until we receive the first sync
	- -G (master with ntpd) now announces a better clock class of 13
	- delayReq period is now uniformly randomized from range
	- updated to the PTPv2 messages rates (sync / delayreq / announce )
	- operator is warned once when the we slew the clock at maximum speed
	- and several others too minor too mention

	* System fixes and new features

	- Frequency adjustment is now calculated in double precision
	- Kernel timestamps are now in nanoseconds precision
	- Timer system overhead was reduced to 16 alarms per second (was 1000)
	- each reset now generates an IGMP leave/join operation to
	  the multicast group
	- Log file is now appended, with the right permissions
	- Debug messages show a timestamp
	- Signals are now processed synchronously (to avoid race conditions)
	- Configurable amount of logging (to avoid filling up /var/log)
	- client now checks own filelock, $0 and well-known daemons.
	- unicast messages can use DNS
	- syslog support (-S)
	- quality file can be generated with received syncs (-R)
	- messages can be dumped for debug (-P)
	- gnore packets that result in large deltas (-M)
	- SIGUSR1 now steps the clock to the current PTP offset
	- SIGUSR2 now cycles the domain number (useful for testing)
	- reverted R135 timer change from integer back to floating point
	- rand() is now seeded with last digits of our own mac address
	- IGMP_refresh waits 100ms between drop() and add()
	- checked to run without leaks inside valgrind 3.5.0
	- last message received is identified by a column on the statistics log
	- messages are sent to Syslog by default. reversed -S flag
	- statistcs file now display /etc/ethers names (besides mac address)
	- option -C is console mode with full verbosity
	- startup warnings are also duplicated in stdout
	- startup: lockfile is checked twice: once at init, to return
	  correct errorlevel, and a second time after deaemon()
	- check for root uid()
	- improvements in parallel daemons checking
	- command line parameters are dumped at init
	- Set the unicast flag when sending unicast packets
	  (experimental, hybrid mode only).

	- Reimplemented integer64_to_internalTime not to use doubles
	- Replaced divTime by div2Time
	- Replaced all time.seconds = time.nanoseconds = 0 by clearTime(&time)
	- Replaced all hex values by named flags
	- Optimized comparison of clockIdentity in bmc.c
	- Resolved issue of comparison of offsetScaledLogVariance 
	- Optimized bmcStateDecision not to call bmcDataSetComparison so often with the same parameters
	- displayStats now uses getTime instead of gettimeofday

2011-02-01  George Neville-Neil  <gnn@neville-neil.com>

	* Add support for DNS lookup of timeserver for unicast.

	* Add support for unicasting delay requests.

	* Add code to dump packets on demand via the -P flag as well as in
	response to updates that violate either the -M or -O flags.

2010-10-12  George Neville-Neil  <gnn@neville-neil.com>

	* 2.1.0 First main line release of PTPv2 code base
	(IEEE-1588-2008)

	* Add code to limit how much of an offset or delay the client is
	willing to tolerate.

	* Add support for BINTIME on FreeBSD which gives more accurate
	packet timestamps.

	* Add quality file support

	* Fix significant bugs that prevented correct operation in
	End-to-End mode.

	* Add support for syslog.

	* Add support for user configurable TTL.

	* Clean up code formatting, headers, comments etc.
